# invisible-test

This application has both the client and server sides. The client side is built with react and it consumes the api as created on the server side. I use Axios to get the data and display. I also chose some warm colors to go with it. 



## To run the server

Change the working directory to server and run

<code>
  npm install
  npm start
</code>

## To run the Client

Change the working directory to Client and run

<code>
  npm install
  npm start
</code>
